# random-problems-from-the-internet

I started this in my first week of university to try and learn how to code using java from scratch while figuring out algorithms, logic etc. 

Hopefully I can start putting up problems in other languages too once I learn them. I currently have an interest in C++ due to how prolific it is and the learning curve involed.
